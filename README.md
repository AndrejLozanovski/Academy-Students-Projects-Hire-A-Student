# BrainsterLabs

This is my first ever mini project made. 
Place where you can preview projects made by the students in a academy, and potentionally to hire a student to work for your company if you are satisfied with their work.

This website is responsive and it works on desktop, tablet and mobile resolution.

The projects from the students are listed on the homepage, initially they are all listed but you can filter them by academy from marketing, programming academy and design.
In mobile resoulution there are initially listed 6 projects instead all of them, but they are made with pagination and with clicking the button "Прикажи повеќе" another 6 projects are listed.

In the navbar there are links to academy for marketing, programming, data science and design.
There is also a button "Вработи наш студент" that leads to another page where you can fill out a form if you are interested in hiring a student to work for your company. The form have validation made with basic knowledge in JavaScript which won't let you send the informations if something is missing or it's wrong. The field for mobile number "Контакт телефон" works only with prefix for Macedonia (+389).
